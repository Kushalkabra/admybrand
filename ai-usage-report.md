  - **ChatGPT (GPT-4)** – Core assistant for writing reusable components, responsive layouts, and custom animation logic
  - **Cursor AI** – Used as the smart code editor, enabling fast debugging and quick scaffolding of entire sections using inline prompts
  - **Lovable AI** – Assisted in layout direction, text styling, UI idea generation, and generating clean Tailwind component ideas

- **Key Use Cases**:
  - UI layout creation with **Tailwind CSS**, including grid and flex layouts
  - Hero section animation with **Framer Motion**, including smooth transitions and text animations
  - Modular and reusable component creation (cards, buttons, navbars, toggles)
  - Generating unique visual patterns like **gradient grids**, glassmorphism, and scroll-based fade-ins
  - Writing compelling, professional marketing text for features and CTAs
  - Debugging layout issues and fine-tuning responsive behavior
  - Designing mobile-first components with Tailwind classes
